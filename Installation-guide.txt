1, Building and Installing on Windows using MSYS2
    !! DO NOT INCLUDE SPACE FOR YOUR PATH OF EVERYTHING
    You will use 
        MSYS2 / MingW64 toolchain 
        or
        MSYS2 / MingW64 UCRT toolchain 
    for building and installation.
    First, you need to install MSYS2 on your Windows system.
    (note: you will need Windows 7 or later for MSYS2, and you always want to use the 64-bit version)
    Check out https://www.msys2.org/ to install MSYS2, follow the instruction on MSYS2 website for how to install the toolchains.

a, using MingW64 traditional MSVCRT toolchain:
    After install MSYS2 and mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain, oepn the "MSYS2 MinGW x64" console from Start Menu.
    !! You want to keep the default path of installation, unless VS code and some text editor may not recongnize the compiler automatically
    You will finish rest of the progress in this console
    In the console, type:
        "g++ --version"
    to ensure GCC is install properly. If you see the version info, you can proceed. Otherwise, you need to install them properly.

    In the console, type:
        "pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake"
    Follow the instruction, after the installation is complete.Then, to use gui, type:
        "pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-qt6-base"
    Follow the instruction, after the installation is complete. Install ninja, type:
        "pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja"
    Follow the instruction, after the installtion is complete. You are ready for build.

b, build install the library 
    Navigate to your nana source folder, which is this folder, type:
        "cd /path/to/the/folder"
        !! You MUST type the path in Unix style, using '/' instead of '\'
    Then type:
        "cmake-gui"
    In cmake-gui, you need to select the source folde of nana and the build folder.
    Now, click "configure" and select "Ninja" for the generator, then click "finish".
    Change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX change to "C:/msys64/mingw64", you may have different folder for MSYS2, just make sure that you select the mingw64 subfolder in it.
    Make sure the box of NANA_CMAKE_INSTALL is checked.
    Click "generate".
    Close cmake-gui

    Go back to the console, navigate to the build folder, type:
        "cd build"
    Build the project by typing:
        "ninja"
    Wait the build process to finish
    (on my 6 core 12 thread, Windows 10 64-bit, it takes about 26s)
    Then install by typing:
        "ninja install"
    The installation is finished now. 
    
    include header
        "#include <nana/gui.hpp>"
        ... 
    and libraries
        "libnana.a"
        "libgdi32.a"
        "libcomdlg32.a"
        "libz.a"
